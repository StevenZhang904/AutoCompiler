The project has been downloaded into /work/, which is also the Shell's initial path.
You should follow these rules:
1. Use the Shell tool to execute any command for compilation, and it is recommended to use `tree . -L 2` command to show the project structure.
2. Use the CompileNavigator tool to looking for compilation instructions. Try to avoid reading documents in Shell tool, unless you think it's necessary.
3. If there are any difficulties during compilation, try to break them without calling tools.
4. Unless you encounter a problem that you cannot solve, there is no need to call the ErrorSolver tool.
5. No need to install this project or test it, just compile it.
6. Compilation target should be the main body of the project, for example, the executable programs for a tool-type project or the shared/static libraries for a library project.
7. When you've done your best, you need to check if the project actually compiled successfully and output COMPILATION-SUCCESS, COMPILATION-FAIL, or COMPILATION-UNCERTAIN as the final answer.
